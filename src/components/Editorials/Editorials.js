          After witnessing an unprecedented havoc raged by the World war 2 and
          miserable failure of the United Nations' predecessor League of
          Nations, the world wanted peace. A total of 850 delegates and 2500
          press and radio persons from various nations gathered at San Francisco
          conference making it one of the largest conferences in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of creating an international organization for world peace was
          officially mentioned in a joint four-nation declaration signed by the
          United States of America, the United Kingdom, the USSR, and China in
          1943 at the Moscow conference.
        </p>
        <p>
          The charter of the United Nations was adopted unanimously on 25 June
          1945 at the end of the San Francisco conference which was signed by 51
          founding nations(Poland signed it later). The charter came into force
          on 24 October 1945 as per its article 110, paragraph 3, after the
          deposition of instruments of ratification by permanent 5 member states
          and the majority of the other signatories. This day is now observed as
          the United Nations day.

          Much has been said about the relevance, success, and failures of the
          United Nations. Today, United Nations' activities impact billions of
          people around the world. It has engaged in promoting disarmament and
          combating extremism and terrorism. It has bought together nations to
          agree to attain Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs). It has assisted
          people in areas of armed conflict, humanitarian aid in natural
          disasters, protected human rights, and ensured gender equality. The
          biggest credit, of course, will be given to the United Nations for
          saving the world from another world war
        </p>
        <p>
          There has been a 40% decline in conflicts since 1990 due to UN support
          and mediation. International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) ensures
          nuclear material is used only for peaceful purposes and has agreements
          with over 180 countries. The United Nations treaties limit works to
          produce nuclear weapons. The United Nations Genocide Convention
          prevents and punishes actions of genocide during the war and peaceful
          times. The Security Council recommends actions for its violation. From
          fostering democracy, improving literacy, preventing human rights
          violations, promoting women's rights, combating terrorism, promoting
          press freedom, and combating climate change, the list of United
          Nations' successes goes on.

          The world's biggest intergovernmental organization is not free from
          dark spots. The success rate in solving global conflicts is still not
          desirable. The United Nations had suspended South Africa from the
          organization as a punishment for its apartheid policy in 1974 world
          it's only working hard just to end with condemning Russia's invasion
          of Ukraine. Russia still remains a member of the organization despite
          its invasion of sovereign nations and committing war crimes. The
          United Nations sanctions do not work as Russia can veto the Security
          Council resolutions. China still sits in the United Nations Human
          Rights Council(UNHRC) despite its atrocities against the Uyghurs in
          Xinjiang province. The World Health Organisation(WHO) faced much flak
          for allegedly not disclosing the true information regarding the
          covid-19 disease. China impeded the WHO investigation into the
          disease. The success rate of the Paris Agreement is not good as
          developed nations are not releasing the required funds to be used by
          developing nations for tackling climate change.

          <strong>Challenges in 21st century</strong>

          The United Nations has much on its plate. The United Nations has to
          work actively to prevent any break out of violence by pre-emptive
          analysis of the threatening situation. The visit of the UN
          Secretary-General to Moscow came too late to broker a deal on the
          evacuation of civilians from the besieged Azovstal steelworks in
          Mariupol in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Mali has seen two coups in
          the last 2 years with the death of numerous civilians. Restrictions
          imposed by Mali impede the UN's peacekeeping mission in the execution
          of its work. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has
          said the world is going to be 2Â°C warmer by the end of this century. A
          one-meter rise in sea level will displace 7.1 million people in India.
          India has set the target year 2070 to achieve net-zero carbon
          emissions. The covid-19 pandemic has increased the poverty and school
          dropout numbers of children. The world is not on track to achieve
          Sustainable Development Goal 2, Zero Hunger by 2030. The pandemic has
          worsened the situation. The United Nations is seen as having selective
          nature of condemning states for violations.

          <strong>Reforms Required</strong>
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          The current situation is different from that in 1945. The world order
          has changed, new international and regional challenges are emerging,
          and many nations have become significant in the world. It's therefore
          much required that the United Nations must carry out reforms in its
          structure and working. The United Nations Security Council is one of
          the main bodies which has 5 permanent member states with vetoes. It
          must expand its veto and permanent membership in new region-based
          groupings. The G4 nations( Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) support
          each other's bid for permanent seats. The General Assembly seems to be
          a mere spectator as its recommendations are non-binding and leads to
          the ineffectiveness of the UN. It should be changed. The International
          Monetary Fund(IMF) and the World Bank have been alleged for many
          irregularities and a lack of transparency. The work should be made
          clear and concerns should be addressed. The investigations of the WHO
          should be carried out to find the origin of Covid-19.
