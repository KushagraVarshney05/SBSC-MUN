          It operates under Internal Quality Assurance Cell(IQAC) of college
          with an aim to provide student community a platform to learn
          diplomacy, debating and discussion. Model United Nations is an
          academic simulation of the United Nations in which students roleplay
          as the delegates of different countries in various committees (say
          UNSC, UNHRC, etc) and then debate on the agenda at hand according to
          the protocols and rules of the UN itself. Additionally, the society
          advances the Government of India's Youth Parliament Program(YPP) which
          aims at inculcating values of Indian constitution and raising
          awareness about various legislative processes and laws in India. In
          YPP, students represent portfolios of different Indian politicians in
          simulated Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and All India Political Parties Meet
          (AIPPM). It's not a highly educational activity, but is also filled
          with a lot of fun.

          <strong>Mission: </strong>
          Our mission is to uphold democratic values and encourage awareness,
          understanding, tolerance, and acceptance of different beliefs and
          cultures among students. We provide a platform for students where they
          involve in the problem-solving and consensus-building process and
          learn leadership skills through positive participation in debate and
          discussion on the world's most pressing issues. We endeavour to instil
          in students the skills of diplomacy, research, communication,
          cooperation, critical thinking, negotiation and decision making.
